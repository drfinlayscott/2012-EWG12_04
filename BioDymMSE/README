Code for development of MSE analysis to support the STECF EWG 12 04, dealing with the international dimensions of the CFP.

To run the code it's necessary to install the development version of FLR. You can run install.packages(repos="http://flr-project.org/Rdevel") from within your R session (R>2.13.0). Or just contact me <ernesto.jardim@jrc.ec.europa.eu>.
