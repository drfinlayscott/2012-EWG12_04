Hi Ernesto:=20

I hope that you are well. Your meeting sounds interesting.=20

from my perspective, the SISAM categorization was developed to encourage ap=
propriate application of methods, so we should welcome such references. As =
you wrote, it has not been published yet, but I suggest that you reference =
ICES Strategic Initiative on Stock Assessment Methods (SISAM) and the sympo=
sium website (http://ices.dk/iceswork/symposia/wcsam.asp) to credit the peo=
ple involved and help advertise the symposium.=20

Thanks,=20

categorization you're preparing under SISAM and adjust it to the CECAF,=20

My problem is that I don't see it published and I'd like to reference it=20
properly and give the credits to those who deserve them. How can we do it ?=
